# Reality Toolkit - Interaction SDK

## About

The interaction SDK is an extension to the [Reality Toolkit](https://realitytoolkit.io/) framework. An extensive collection of services, tools and utilities to develop cutting edge AR/VR/XR applications using the [Unity](https://www.unity3d.com) game engine.

Use the interaction SDK to implement user interaction with virtual objects in your application or game.

## Core Concept

At the core of the interaction SDK there are two key actors.

| **Interactor** | **Interactable** |
|----------------|------------------|
| The interactor is anything that interacts with your virtual objects. Usually this will be the user's controllers or hands in case of hand tracking. Learn more about Interactors [here](Interactors.md)           | Interactables are objects that can be interacated with in the scene.
